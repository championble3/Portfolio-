# PORTFOLIO

- **Description:** This project includes several Jupyter Notebooks and a CSV file related to gender classification and NBA data analysis.
- **Files:**
  - [gender_classifier.ipynb](gender_classifier.ipynb):  A Jupyter Notebook for gender classification.
  - [nba_data.csv](nba_data.csv): Dataset containing NBA data.
  - [nba_project.ipynb](nba_project.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook for NBA data analysis.
  - [nba_project_nn.ipynb](nba_project_nn.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook for NBA data analysis using neural networks.


### Project - [nba_project.ipynb](nba_project.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook for NBA data analysis. 
- **Description:** This project is aimed at predicting whether NBA players have been named for the team of the season. However, there's a issue: a lot more data from one class than the other, which makes accurate predictions challenging. To overcome this imbalance, I conducted extensive data mining. My analysis covers NBA players from 1980 to 2022, despite the disproportionate representation of data from one class. After all preparations I started to create a model and then evaluate it using Random Forest.

### Project -[nba_project_nn.ipynb](nba_project_nn.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook for NBA data analysis using neural networks.
- **Description:** In this next phase of the project, I'm experimenting with a neural network to see how it performs compared to our previous methods. It's like trying out a new approach to see if it can outperform what we've already tried.

### Project - [gender_classifier.ipynb](gender_classifier.ipynb):

- **Description:** This project is all about predicting gender based on given data. Using Python tools for handling and visualizing data, it builds a model to guess whether a person is male or female. It's a fun dive into the world of machine learning and data analysis. This little project uses fake data, so it's easy to see what's going on without digging too much. It's like solving a simple puzzle with a few pieces â€“ not too complicated, but still a neat way to learn how computers can guess stuff based on what they see. I compared a few different predictors to see which one did the best.
